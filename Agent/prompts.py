---

Please complete the following analysis and output JSON:

1. **Analyze current factor pool weaknesses**:
   - Are factor types too homogeneous? (e.g., all momentum type, lacking volatility type)
   - Are window periods too concentrated? (e.g., all short-term, lacking medium/long-term)
   - Is feature usage too homogeneous? (e.g., only using close, lacking volume, high/low, etc.)

2. **Analyze which factors improved returns**:
   - Identify factor characteristics with greatest contribution from attribution analysis

3. **Generate seed factor suggestions**:
   - Generate 10-20 differentiated seed factors targeting weaknesses
   - **Strictly use the operators and features defined above, do not use other operators**
